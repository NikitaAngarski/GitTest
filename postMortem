PostMortem 

1. Two things that went well was that the code and readme was unexpectedly easy to upload, and that the software automatically picks up local changes. I used to 
work with git on linux, which was a little more complicated, but this is just about the same with windows. I would like to see if I can do the
same with wsl soon. Another thing that went well was that I could find everything on the github main site with relative ease as well. 

2. One thing that went poorly was that I lost the folder where I put the repository for a little bit, so that wasn't ideal but I found a
quick fix to it by reorganizing my folder tree. 

3. One cool thing is that my group started working on the project on github already, so everything from the wireframe and so on will be 
documented on there.
